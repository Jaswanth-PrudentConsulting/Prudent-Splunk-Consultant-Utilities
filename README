# Prudent Consultant Suite

**v5.1.2 | Professional Edition**

A unified, client-side operations suite designed for Splunk Consultants and Administrators. This toolkit streamlines the generation of configuration manifests (ACS), data onboarding stanzas (props.conf), and API commands (REST) through a modern "Glass UI".

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Bulk Operations Engine
A single interface to generate JSON configuration manifests from **CSV** or **Excel** data.
* **Supported Operations:**
    * **Core:** Indexes, HEC Tokens.
    * **Apps:** Splunkbase Apps, Private Apps.
    * **Network:** IP Allowlists, Outbound Ports.
    * **System:** Maintenance Windows.
* **Smart Features:**
    * **Dynamic Templates:** Automatically provides the correct CSV/XLSX template for your selected task.
    * **Input Validation:** Scans files for errors (e.g., invalid CIDR formats, non-numeric retention) *before* processing to prevent ACS errors.

### 2. Props Builder (New!)
A dedicated GUI tool for generating optimized `props.conf` stanzas for data onboarding.
* **Capabilities:**
    * Configure **Line Breaking** (`LINE_BREAKER`, `SHOULD_LINEMERGE`, `TRUNCATE`).
    * Define **Timestamp Extraction** (`TIME_PREFIX`, `TIME_FORMAT`, `MAX_TIMESTAMP_LOOKAHEAD`).
    * Set **Timezone & Encoding** (`TZ`, `CHARSET`).
    * **Auto-Correction:** Automatically ensures stanza names are enclosed in square brackets `[]`.

### 3. Command Generator
Construct complex Splunk API requests without syntax errors.
* **Dual API Support:** Intelligently routes between **ACS (`/adminconfig/v2`)** and **REST (`/services`)** endpoints based on your selection.
* **Library:** Includes 20+ endpoint categories covering Users, Roles, Limits, Restarts, and Knowledge Objects.
* **Smart Auth:** Supports Basic Auth and Bearer Tokens (with auto-hiding fields).

## 🛠️ User Experience (UX)

* **Session Memory:** The suite remembers your preferences (Base URL, Auth Type, Last Used Tab) between reloads so you don't have to re-type them.
* **Glass UI:** A fully responsive, dark-mode interface designed for readability on Desktops, Tablets, and Mobile devices.
